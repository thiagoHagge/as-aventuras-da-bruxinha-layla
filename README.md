# Run and Jump Game

This is a simple run and jump game built with JavaScript and p5.js. In this project, I learned how to work with animations, gravity, and collision detection to create an interactive game.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to control a character and navigate through a series of enemies by running and jumping. The character moves horizontally across the screen, and the player can make the character jump by pressing the spacebar on desktop or by tapping the screen on mobile devices. The game utilizes gravity to create realistic jumping physics.

The player starts with 3 lives. Each time the character collides with an enemy, one life is lost. The game is over when the player loses all three lives. The player can retry the game by clicking the "Retry" button.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in the development of this game:

- JavaScript: The core programming language used for game logic and interactivity.
- p5.js: A JavaScript library that simplifies the creation of animations and interactive graphics.
- HTML: The structure of the game's web page.
- CSS: Styling elements and layout of the game.

## Game Controls

- **Desktop**: 
  - Press the spacebar to make the character jump.
- **Mobile**: 
  - Tap the screen to make the character jump.


## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the p5.js community for their valuable resources and examples that helped me understand and implement various game development concepts.

## Conclusion

Creating this run and jump game using JavaScript and p5.js was a great learning experience for me. It allowed me to gain hands-on experience with animations, gravity, collision detection, and incorporating the concept of lives in a game. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as I enjoyed building it!
